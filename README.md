# C-Project
C++ Project from an advanced class
**Project 0**: a simple program that moves a character around a game board
**Project 1 First Object Project**: design a game where a human player acts as a predator, while various objects symbolize its prey. 
The primary objective for the player is to pursue, catch, and consume the prey, accumulating calories to stay alive and continue hunting. 
The player uses up calories with every move and will perish if the calorie count reaches zero.
**Project 2 The Prisoner's Dilemma**: A game theoretical idea called 'The Prisoner's Dilemma'.
Copy what Robert Axelrod, a researcher at the University of Michigan, did in the early 1980s.
Try out various strategies for playing the game, pitting each strategy against the others to see which one scores the highest.
**Project 3 Game of Life**: Develop an implementation of Conway's Game of Life
**Project 4 Snake Game**: Implement a snake game and more challenging, an autonomous snake
